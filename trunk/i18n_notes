FORMULA
=======
I have an "original" pot file in pofiles/fp_orig_ref.pot
This file has the header filled-in. Kind of. It stands as the
"memory" of the process.
(When one does a new xgettext, the output gets default header info; thus
I use fp_orig_ref to merge that header in.)

Don't damage or lose this file. (Well, I can always make a new one.)

UPDATE
======
Scratch that. I can't get the headers to survive properly. Fuck it.
I write a date and the version in the Makefile, but the metadata
is ignored and is just gonna be default crap. Forever.

See the Makefile for the actual steps.

When there are code changes: make a new pot file.
1. make
2. make update
3. loop while dev

When there is new translation work:
1. make
2. get the new stuff into the correct .po file in pofiles
   It may require a msgmerge off to the side.
3. make update

When you are ready for a release:
1. make
2. make update
3. make mos





From the manual
===============
msgmerge [option] def.po ref.pot

The msgmerge program merges two Uniforum style .po files together. The def.po file is an existing PO file with translations which will be taken over to the newly created file as long as they still match; comments will be preserved, but extracted comments and file positions will be discarded. The ref.pot file is the last created PO file with up-to-date source references but old translations, or a PO Template file (generally created by xgettext); any translations or comments in the file will be discarded, however dot comments and file positions will be preserved. Where an exact match cannot be found, fuzzy matching is used to produce better results. 



DEMO
==

in testpo:
I made a short A.pot. Header only. Nothing past the initial:
# I changed this
# Copyright (C) 2017
# This file is distributed under the same license as the fptest package.
# Donn yadda
#
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: A 0.1\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2017-12-10 10:56+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"Language: \n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

Then I made B.pot from the source:
xgettext -o B.pot -L Python ../fontypythonmodules/strings.py

Then I merged A and B!
msgmerge A.pot B.pot -o B.pot
(The order is NB)

Now I have B.pot that carries the headers etc. Phew.

Now I can go merge the fr_FR.UTF-8.po file with B.pot

(Update - Actually, this doesn't work either.)
