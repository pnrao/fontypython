basic_idea = _("""Manage your fonts on GNU/Linux
==============================
Many designers have collections of font files on their drives. 
Fonty Python will help you gather and structure them into collections 
called "Pogs" -- a place to keep tyPOGraphy. Well, why not?

Fonty lets you you select fonts visually and place them into Pogs which you 
can then install or remove as you require. (Your font files never move 
from where they are. Only links are used.)

Example: You create a "logos" Pog where you place logotype fonts.
When you want to use them, simply install the "logos" Pog and start your 
design app! When you're done, uninstall the "logos" Pog; the fonts will 
go away.

Fonty can also "hush" unwanted fonts. This hides system fonts, leaving
only those Pogs you want in your apps. The Inkscape font chooser, for 
example, is more usable after a hush.
(This is temporary;  an "unhush" will switch the system fonts on again.)

Fonty is great for just looking at fonts, wherever they are, without having 
to install them.""")

Examples: All using short options, see -h
=========
{c} /path/to/fonts/ttfs/a
  This will start off showing the fonts in that path.

{c} /path/to/fonts/ttfs/b Trouser
  This will let you view and choose fonts from the path and it will store them 
  in a Pog named Trouser. The Pog will be created if it's not already there.

{c} Lumberjack
  This will let you see the fonts in the Pog named Lumberjack. You can also 
  uninstall individual fonts by selecting them. A cross will appear indicating 
  the fonts that will be uninstalled.

{c} Camelot Spamalot
  This will let you see and choose fonts in Camelot and it will store them 
  in "Spamalot". It lets you copy fonts between Pogs.

{c} -i Cheese
  Will install the fonts in Cheese so you can use them in other apps.

{c} -u Trouser
  Will uninstall the fonts listed in Trouser.

{c} -s 128
  Will set the point size in the gui to 128 - Crazy man!

{c} -n 25
  Will show 25 fonts at a time, in the gui. Beware large numbers!

{c} -s 64 -v 10 Pimple
  Will set the point size to 64, paging to 10,open the gui and display the fonts
  in Pimple.

{c} -p Glutton
  Purging a font. If there are any fonts in Glutton that are not really on your 
  drive/media anymore (perhaps you deleted them or the cat did) this will go 
  through the Pog and cull them.

{c} -c /some/path/to/fonts
  If Fonty keeps crashing on /some/path/to/fonts then you should run a check on
  that folder. This will mark the dangerous fonts and let you view that folder 
  in the future.

{c} -a /some/path HolyHandGrenade
  This will put all the fonts in that path into the Pog called HolyHandGrenade.

{c} -A /some/path Tutto
  This will do the same as -a: starting in some path, but it will then walk 
  down through *all* sub-folders too. The fonts will be placed in Tutto.

{c} --hush mysysfonts
  Will hush (silence) all the fonts in your system except the ones in 
  "mysysfonts" and any other Pogs you have installed. Other apps will 
  now have fewer fonts to choose from, making life much easier for you.

The idea
========
Often there are too many fonts reported by your system. In your apps, like Inkscape,
they clutter the font chooser. This is a way to "hush" that, to quieten the noise.

Fonty will install a select Pog of system fonts (which you must pick) and then will
reject *all* the system's fonts, leaving only the Pogs which you install.

This does no damage and you can "unhush" at any time to reverse it.

Hushing
=======
1. Relies on fontconfig, which should be installed on most modern Linux desktops.
   You can verify if it's there by trying this command:
   fc-list

   If that shows no error, you're good.

2. Fontconfig's user directory:
   The path is {{fcpaf}}
   Make sure it exists and try fonty again.

3. System fonts: Put some fonts in a Pog that you must create and choose.
   I suggest those in /usr/share/fonts, like: 
   DejaVu*, Free*, Ubuntu*, Liberation*

The way it works is that fonty writes an XML file which rejects all fonts that 
are on the path: "/usr/share/fonts"

This may not work on your particular Linux distribution. Please open a ticket
on our site if you have any trouble: {ticket_url}

To hush, using your special Pog from the command line do this:
{fp} --hush yourpoghere

To hush from the gui, ...

Unhushing
=========
To release the hush, use --unhush from the command line or the gui.

The Pog(s) you installed when you hushed will be left installed. Remove
it/them if you must.""").format(fp="fontypython", ticket_url=ticket_url)
##{{fcpaf}} is doubled like that so I can swap it in later.
